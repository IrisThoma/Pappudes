<h1>Want to Support Our Mission?</h1>
    <h2>If you would like to support our effort to share essential tech knowledge with elderly people — and you have some basic technology skills (but most importantly, the passion to help) — we would love to hear from you!

Just send us an email, and we will get in touch to let you know which days we might need your help. Together, we can visit seniors at their homes and assist them in navigating the digital world.</h2>  
<h1>Can't help us practically?
</h1>
<h2>A key part of our mission is funding.
You can donate money to help us continue and purchase the necessary equipment we need to succeed.

Also, if you have an old device — like a computer or mobile phone — that you no longer use, you can donate it to help seniors who don’t have access to such technology.

If you can support us in any way, please contact us via email. Your help would mean a lot to us!</h2>
